================================================================================
to compile run the following
  `gcc main.c -o main`

p-machine offers two modes. regular mode, and interactive mode.
afterwards, run the `main` executable using this command. NOTE: without
the -i flag, p-machine will not produce a diagnostic stack trace;.
  ./main <yourfile>

to run in interactive mode, use this command
  ./main -i <yourfile>

interactive mode allows you to print the stack out at each step and make use
of other utilities. Interactive mode will ask you to perform one of 9 commands.
in detail, these commands are:

q - silently implode the p-machine 
h - ask the machine for help
s - step through a single fetch-execute cycle
r - run through all instructions 
i - check the status of the machine (ok, error, finished)
c - print out decimal value machine code
o - print out code with stringified opcodes
t - run all instructions and print a stack trace
p - print all registers (stack, register file, as well as pointers)
