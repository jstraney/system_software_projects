# important note: we realized that for assignment 2, we had misinterpreted the
# scope of the lexical analyzer project (the inclusion of the grammar led us to
# check for grammatical validity while we scanned, which made the most sense at
# the time. We realize now that this function is reserved for the parser). For
# that reason, much of the grammatical checking is already done in analyzer.c
# and we are simply scanning the lexeme table per Dr. Montagne's advisement
# (the lexeme table should only contain grammatically valid code based on
# project 2's implementation).

# to compile run the following
gcc *.c -o main

# then to run the compiler, do the following
./main [-l -a -v] <your source code here>
