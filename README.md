# Projects for COP3402
Here is were I'll be working on various projects for COP3402 (System Software)

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository. Using the git command from bash:

```bash
git clone https://jeffstraney/system_software_projects.git
```

Once that is done, you should see the repository cloned to your file system.
The root directory for this project will contain each project for the semester.
